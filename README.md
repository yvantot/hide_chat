<h1>Hide Chat!</h1>

<p>A Chrome extension that hides chat ðŸ“© easily ðŸ‘Œ</p>
<hr />
<h2>Technical Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Hides the chat before Messenger loads</li>
  <li>Hidden chats will stay hidden unless removed by you</li>
  <li>It's fast and doesn't scrawl the DOM to find the chat you want to hide</li>
  <li>Stable. It won't break Messenger unlike similar tools that change the DOM by deleting the element</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>How to Install?</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, I don't have the money to buy the Chrome extension developer license, so you can't install it from the Chrome store.</p>
<p>Please follow these steps for now:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Download the master zip file from https://github.com/yvantot/hide_chat => Code => Download ZIP</li>
  <li>Extract the file to any location, but it must be in its own separate folder</li>
  <li>Go to your Chromium browser (Chrome, Brave, Edge...) > Extension settings > Enable developer mode</li>
  <li>Click Load Unpacked > Select the extracted folder</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h2>How to Use?</h2>
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a0efb583-5ae6-44dd-b388-591d08a0115d"/>
<ol>
  <li>The easiest way is to right-click the chat and choose the extension setting</li>
  <li>Another way is to go to the chat, click the extension, and then click the âž• button</li>
  <li>You can also manually copy the address of the chat: right-click the chat and copy the link or copy it from the browser address bar. Paste it in the input bar and press Enter</li>
</ol>
<h2>Best For</h2>
<p>I don't think you should use this as a replacement for 'Archive'. It's to avoid missing out on important news</p>
<p>I think the best way to use this extension is to only use it on the annoying chats</p>
<h2>Alternatives</h2>
<p>You can still ignore chats with this trick: https://www.reddit.com/r/facebookmessenger/comments/1autbji/how_to_ignoreblock_a_group_chat_updated_2024/. However, you can still see them in your request section. There are people, like me, who find themselves still looking at those chats like a fool.</p>
<p>So, my solution for that is this: it removes any visual trace of the hidden chat.</p>
